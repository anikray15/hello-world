# hello-world
got 0 idea about wtf I'm doing
Hi there, everyone! I'm Anik. I am starting to learn how to use this platform and the others in complience with the IBM's DS course.
I'm a Mechanical Engineer graduated in 2016. Then in this year 2021, I just finished up my Masters in Forensic science.
I'm still jobless and finding a real hard time managing my moneytory expenses! God knows what's gonna happen, I mean, I still didn't get the vaccine even!!
Seems like I gotta explore all available options to start earning and here I am in this DS business, although I barely know a thing or two about it!
